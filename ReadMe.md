# Access Randomizer

A Hollow Knight Randomizer add-on for miscellaneous access checks.

## Mantis Respect

Originally, defeating the Mantis Lords grants all the tribe's respect. This mod turns that into a check, meaning you can get their respect elsewhere and defeating the lords will grant a random item.

Also, if you defeat them without having their respect, they might get a bit salty.

## Hollow Knight Chains

Meant to make playthroughs a bit longer, this adds four items and locations representing the chains that bind the Hollow Knight. Each item will grant the possibility of breaking one of the four chains, and each chain will grant an item. These are considered Major Items, which means they will be penalised by the Longer Progression Chains setting and will be included in the Condensed Spoiler Logger.

If Dreamers are duplicated, two extra Chain items will be included in the pool.

## Unique Keys

This will remove the Simple Key item and replace them with four specific keys for each of the doors meant to be opened with simple keys. In terms of logic, this will very likely get all locations behind these keys be unlocked earlier in progression (as you will no longer need all four keys to reach any of them).

This setting will also permanently add a "Key Tracker" item in your inventory (replacing the Simple Key) that will keep track of which keys have you obtained and which doors were opened.

This setting deletes the concept of Simple Key, and the resulting keys will be duplicated or not depending on the Unique Keys setting. The usage of this setting will override the Key Ring item from Extra Rando (no point in using both, so if you want to have them all in a single location, disable this). If there was a Simple Key among the starting items, a random unique key will be granted instead.

## Split Tram / Elevator

Hallownest has two big elevators in City of Tears that allow you to traverse through different areas, and two Trams that serve a similar purpose. What if accessing them was slightly more cursed and split it like Dash, Claw or whatever can be split? This setting allows exactly that.

## Trap Bench

You ever thought "why would I ever use the Beast Den backdoor if I can just sit in the bench"? Well, think again, because this setting might force you to... Unless you find the Trap Bench item first, that is.

## Custom Keys

This setting manages 6 item/location pairs (well, one of them is only an item):

- Mapper Key: By default, rando saves have Iselda always be available. Turns out, Corfiner may or not have lost the shop key. This will add a location somewhere close to Crossroads Cornifer and an item that will trigger accesibility to the shop's door in Dirtmouth.
- Sly Key: Rescuing Sly has always been a no brainer in rando runs, but what if Sly actually dropped the key outside of his Crossroads hut? That'd add a location that, when randomized, might just not be his key.
- Bretta Key: Rescuing Bretta's cool, but turns out, just talking to her won't be enough to open her room. She'll be back in Dirtmouth, but unfortunately she left her key on the Fungal Wastes - good thing that getting to her room without vertical is easier if randomized.
- Zote Key: Why does he have a key to Bretta's basement? No one knows, but we do know he lost it on Deepnest.
- Relic Key: Tired of going straight into Lemm's Shop only to find out he walked out to chill at the fountain? Now you can do the exact same thing, but find out he completely locked the shop behind a key. Good news is, you won't have to track down if you have to go to the fountain when having dreamers. Also adds a new location somewhere below the shop - potentially down the drain.
- Glade Key: If this setting is on, the Seer will no longer unlock the Spirit's Glade when you reach 200 Essence. Instead, a new key is added that unlocks that particular transition.

## Integrations

If FStats is enabled, a new page for the obtention of each randomized item. Exceptions include:
- Mantis Respect: The entry will be included regardless of randomization settings for it.
- Glade Access: This entry is included whenever you open the Spirit's Glade door, be it with essence or with the key.
